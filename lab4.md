http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

Create a Basecamp post "Lab-4: your name" and simply post the following as plain text. 

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=54B110klDtsc1JFhnz8qXrksUl5
Your Rationale: My rationale for choosing bright purple, blue and red for a new console gaming platform is due to the fact that most gamers are of younger ages and following industry example such as the nintendo switch, xbox and playstation, they all incorporate a bright color along with a darker color to compliment the brighter color. Such as red and blue with black joystick for the switch and xbox with a green x that is silver surrounded by black.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing Chicago Botanical Gardens springtime tours.

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=32R050kk+JJamVAggPRpkD8vexz
Your Rationale: The need for some warm colors along with green is because of the botanical garden theme in which the warm color red and orange represent the spring time in which it is warm and vibrant. While the color green is what symbolizes spring and the shade of a bright vibrant color is representative of spring with the bright sun and lush green scenery.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=30X050k00wO1IW800wO1IW800wO
Your Rationale: Most login pages have simple colors including white and one darker shade. Such as facebook, google and snapchat. They all incorporate a white simpler background with a complimentary color like yellow, blue or red and using white seems to be crucial for a nice login page. Along with a different color that compliments

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=15A050kk+JJamVAggPRpkD8vexz
Your Rationale: The reason for creating a simple light red is for the case that the course is teaching ruby which has the color red as its symbol. The red helps identify that the course is based on ruby.
